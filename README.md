# H.L.M.M
Using FFplay and FFMpeg as a base, this is a very basic "video editor" 
primarily focused on quickly adding sound effects to a video; selected from a series of folders easy to access. <br>
It is very much a work in progress, let me now if you want a feature or something fixed.

# Features

· Quickly add sound to your videos and replace background music<br>
· Drag and Drop file input support, you can also drag a folder into the sound browser window now<br>
· The FFplay window size and location is remembered when you switch out/load a new video<br>
· You can apply an seperate audio filter to each individual audio file in the filterchain<br>
· FREE and OPEN SOURCE<br>
